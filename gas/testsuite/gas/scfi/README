Notes on how the SCFI testsuite is organized:

The SCFI testsuite has target dependent components because most meaningul tests
will need an input which is assembly code.

At this time, support for x86_64 is added.

When adding more tests, please keep CFI annotations updated in the .s files,
even though the testcases are run with --scfi command line option (this means
that the CFI annotations are not processed by GAS).  Adding CFI directives
makes the testcases clearer in terms of the expected unwind data.
